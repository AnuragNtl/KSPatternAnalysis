# KSPatternAnalysis
<h3>A tool to automatically collect Keystroke dynamics data from the user and save in different formats, such as CSV.</h3>
<br>
<h3>
Future work:<h3>
Using Sequence Vectors and Convolution Neural Networks , the data will be used to conclude behavioural characteristics about the user, such as user's present activity.

<h3>Present Goals:</h3>
Need to run the tool with as many users as possible(in the background as a daemon) to collect sufficient data to feed to learning algorithms.

<h3>Warning:</h3> This tool collects keystrokes data.
