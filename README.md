# KSPatternAnalysis
<h3>A tool to automatically collect Keystroke dynamics data, also collect labels to be assigned to the data via GUI prompts(for supervised learning algorithms), from the user and save in different formats, such as CSV.</h3>
<br>
<h3>
As soon as the data collection is complete:</h3>
Using Sequence Vectors and Convolution Neural Networks , the data will be used to conclude behavioural characteristics about the user, such as user's present activity.

<h3>Present Goals:</h3>
Need to run the tool with as many users as possible(in the background as a daemon) to collect sufficient data to feed to learning algorithms.

<h3>Warning:</h3> This tool collects keystrokes data.
